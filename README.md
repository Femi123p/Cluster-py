# Cluster-py
Indexing the data using ElasticSearch, then clustering this data using Guassian Mixture Model and finding its entropy.

import all the nesecessary packages for python using pip command.
Here indexing is done using Elasticsearch from that the data is taken and clustering is done using guassian mixture model.
After clustering is done, always we need to check the entropy so that we can know what is the randmness of our model.

The input file will be in the form of json.
